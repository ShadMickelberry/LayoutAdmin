# Sugar Labs Layout Admin

Sugar Labs Layout Admin provides a new admin tool for Record views. An admin will be able to define the number of columns used in the Record view's Business Card view. The default value is 2. This can help utilize the space on screen to show more fields within the same area.

## Installation & Use
* Download the latest .tgz package here: https://github.com/sugarcrmlabs/LayoutAdmin/releases/latest
* Load the package in your target instance using Module Loader
* Log in as an admin user
* Navigate to 'Layout Settings' area of Admin menu
* Select entry 'Layout Settings'
* List of all modules will be shown. Set number of columns for each module's record view and press the accompanying Save button.
```
